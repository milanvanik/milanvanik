## About Me
I’m a Flutter developer focused on building clean, intuitive, and visually engaging app experiences. My journey into tech started early with a curiosity for devices, visuals, and how thoughtful design can transform simple interactions into meaningful ones.

My primary focus is app development, where I enjoy turning ideas into functional, performant applications. I use tools like Figma when needed to design and prototype interfaces, ensuring the apps I build feel intuitive and well-structured. I’m also an AI enthusiast who enjoys experimenting with new tools to accelerate development and explore ideas—while relying on my own judgment and skills to refine and build the final product.
